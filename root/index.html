					<p>Moon-inspired art, a handmade T-shirt, and a custom denim vest. I've finished a new set of artwork and began working on more adventures.</p>

					<a href="artworkset2.html"><h1>SPRAY ART ON CANVAS</h1></a>
					<p>I've completed many new projects, while improving on some painting techniques. These new paintings are crisper, cleaner, and more detailed. Like my other works, they usually have a story or meaning behind them, but I'm always intrigued on other people's interpretations.</p>

					<h1>ADDITIONS TO THE COLLECTION</h1>
					<p>The majority of my recent efforts have been directed towards creating new canvas paintings, though there has been preperation for some much larger projects.</p>

					<h1>ALTERNATIVE MEDIUMS</h1>
					<p>This project seemed to fit better on one of my most used surf boards, instead of a traditional canvas. I'm not big on display only or sentimental value, so I'll let the ocean erode this away. Let's see how long it lasts.</p>

					<h1>A BETTER T-SHIRT</h1>
					<p>The standard issue T, but better: hand drawn, cut, and sewn. Slim with some extra length for a perfect fit.</p>

					<h1>12 HAND-MADE T-SHIRTS</h1>
					<p>These original 12 T-shirts were designed, cut and sewn by hand and numbered in order of creation. All are of varying designs featuring different fits, lengths, necklines, sleeves and styles. Material is a cotton-polyester blend.</p>

					<h1>LUNAR NEW YEAR</h1>
					<p>Lunar New Year was probably first conceived in a seedy Chinese restaurant somewhere years ago. It's a concept EP in an attempt to convince myself of a few ideas that no longer have any place in my head.</p>
