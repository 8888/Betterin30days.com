				<p>I was sick for quite a long time. It would be on and off at times, and brutally consistent at others. It was very easy to hope for a simple solution: see a doctor, sit through some tests, take 500 milligrams twice a day after I eat, and I'd be better in 30 days. "Call me in the morning if you have any problems." Perfect.</p>
				<p>Even though my quick fix was terribly unrealistic, it stuck with me. The idea faded from its hopeful solution but gave me a new perspective. I realized it was useless to sit back and hope for everything to be better in 30 days. I started making a conscious effort to better myself whenever I could. I was thrilled to question my old ways of everything and anything. I attacked my status quo, mercilessly changing or removing any source of negativity, especially if caused by myself. This will forever be a work in progress. The main difficulties began once the glamour wore off and it became very easy to become lenient, forgetful, and regressive. These periods will fluctuate, but usually some idea or event snaps me back out of my coma.</p>
				<p>While this is undisputedly a positive change anyone can make for themselves, I eventually found a guideline to follow. I learned this was even more important, and difficult, to constantly adhere to. It became easy to think more about the future, which left less room for the present. Regardless of any great changes I prepare myself for in the future, without any focus on the current moment, I'm ignoring every opportunity to truly make a difference. Any point in the future remains unreachable, but I will always have right now.</p>
				<p>My first realization of my desire to improve has changed my life and will continue to, but we can't let ourselves get overly obsessed with the future. Our current place, at this very moment, is everything we have.</p>
				<p>Make the most of the moment.</p>

				<p>Better in 30 Days is an idea turned into a label that allows me to collect all of my projects together.<br>I create using many different mediums with the goal to inspire positive change.</p>
