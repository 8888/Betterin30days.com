# Better In 30 Days
My personal website for my artwork<br>
https://www.betterin30days.com/

# Design
This is a php-based website to display my artwork and creations. The homepage works as a blog with posts and updates. There are sepereate sections for paintings, music, clothing, and other creations. An SQL database is used to store the data for the posts on the homepage. There is a hashed password protected area to manage posts. New posts can be added and past posts can be edited.
